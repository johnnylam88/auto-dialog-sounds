## Overview

[Auto Dialog Sounds][project] will automatically enable and disable the dialog sounds depending on the instance that your character is in.  By default, dialog sounds are automatically disabled in open world zones and enabled elsewhere.

This addon is primarily useful right now for getting rid of the Headless Horseman laughter and poetic speech.

## Features:

+ Choose whether to enable dialog sounds in Arenas, Battlegrounds, Dungeons, Raids, *Looking For Group* instances, or open world zones.
